        At FAME, we understand that every child learns and grows at their own pace. That's why our curriculum is
        designed to
        offer a unique and engaging journey for students from Nursery through prep 6. Our dedicated teachers foster a
        love
        of
        learning through developmentally-appropriate activities that address the mind, body, and spirit.</p>

                <h3 class="text-bold info">Rooted in Christian Values</h3>

                FAME incorporates core Christian values throughout the curriculum, nurturing kindness, respect, and
                compassion. By
                integrating age-appropriate Bible stories, inspirational songs, and thoughtful discussions, we encourage
                students to
                explore their faith in a supportive environment.</p>

                <h3 class="text-bold info">Empowering All Learners</h3>

                FAME celebrates diversity in learning styles and abilities. Our smaller class sizes allow for
                personalized
                attention,
                and our teachers utilize a variety of engaging instructional methods. This includes hands-on activities,
                differentiated
                instruction, and positive reinforcement to ensure each student reaches their full potential.

                                                <li>Cognitive Development: Playful activities stimulate language
                                                    acquisition, early literacy and numeracy skills, and
                                                    critical thinking abilities.</li></br>
                                                <li>Social-Emotional Development: Play provides opportunities for
                                                    children to develop positive social interactions,
                                                    collaboration skills, and effective communication. Children learn to
                                                    share, take turns, and resolve conflicts in a

                                                <li>Physical Development: Active play promotes healthy growth and

                                                <li>Creative Expression: Through art activities, storytelling, and
                                                    dramatic play, children explore their creativity
                                                    and imagination.</li>

                                            secondary education. Our program goes beyond simply
                                            preparing students for the National Primary School Examination (NPSE). We
                                            cultivate a learning environment that ignites
                                            intellectual curiosity, fosters critical thinking skills, and equips
                                            students with the academic tools and confidence
                                            needed to thrive in Junior Secondary School and beyond.</br>

                                                <li>Mastering Language Across Diverse Landscapes:

                                                    The curriculum in Prep 4-6 places a strong emphasis on language
                                                    proficiency. We move beyond rote memorization to
                                                    develop a comprehensive skillset that allows students to effectively
                                                    use language in various contexts. This includes
                                                    honing their listening, speaking, reading, writing, viewing, and
                                                    representing skills. Students engage with a range of
                                                    multicultural and multimedia resources, developing a strong
                                                    understanding of information and ideas regardless of its

                                                <li>Nurturing Critical Thinkers:

                                                    FAME goes beyond spoon-feeding facts. We actively engage students in
                                                    the learning process, encouraging them to analyze
                                                    information, ask questions, and form their own conclusions. This
                                                    approach fosters critical thinking skills, allowing
                                                    students to become independent learners who are confident in their
                                                    ability to solve problems and evaluate situations

                                                    Transitioning to Junior Secondary School demands increased
                                                    independence and academic responsibility. At FAME, we equip

                                                    We emphasize strong organizational skills, teaching
                                                    them effective study habits and time management techniques. This
